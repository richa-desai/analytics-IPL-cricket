## Problems

1. Total runs scored by team

3. Foreign umpire analysis (Obtain a source for country of origin of umpires. Plot a chart of number of umpires by in IPL by country. Indian umpires should be ignored as this would dominate the graph.)

4. Stacked chart of matches played by team by season (Plot a stacked bar chart of ...
- number of games played
- by team
- by season)


5. Number of matches played per year for all the years in IPL. (Plot a bar chart.)

6. Number of matches won per team per year in IPL. (Plot a stacked bar chart.)
